    <p>This past week I had finished a big project for my work and was trying to decide what to build next. We had discussed several major new projects that included a major overhaul of one of the core interfaces to our application. However, instead of starting that, I took some time to fix a bunch of nagging little bugs that had been bothering me (and our users) for some time.</p>

<p>Now, you might say, “But Chris, what about the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">lean startup approach</a>? What about the <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</a>? Aren’t you guys supposed to be a scrappy startup? Well, yes…</p>

<p>But…</p>

<p>Don’t forget the little stuff. It represents your biggest opportunity to get maximum impact for a minimum of effort. Yes, I could have re-architected our front-end stack to implement new features, but fixing bad copy, broken CSS and a poor user interface served our customers far better than that would have. The key word in MVP is viable. It isn’t just a minimum product; it has to be one that validates and implements (successfully) your business model. Otherwise, it’s just junk.</p>

<p>There is a second reason to think about the little stuff: putting the user first. Sometimes, it is tempting to fall into the trap of wanting to take out a new canvas and make big, bold strokes to hit your targets. Certainly, not falling into ruts is a key startup success trait. However, by taking what you have and re-focusing on what about it is broken, you get much closer to a workable product than constantly starting over. A good engineer doesn’t start over their project from scratch every time they find a mistake. A good engineer fixes it and refactors it into a good, workable product. The same holds for designing your product. Making it better is more rewarding and more beneficial to your users than starting over.</p>
