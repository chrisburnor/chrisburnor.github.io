    <p>First let me start off by saying that I absolutely love my terminal. I spend literally all day with a terminal window open, and it&rsquo;s usually in the foreground. Honestly, if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that most of my work is implemented in the browser (and that the best <a href="http://blog.framebase.io/post/43973262180/the-best-programmers-are-the-quickest-to-google">developers are the first to Google</a>), I could probably ditch the GUI entirely.</p>

<p>However, it is because of this love that I would like to rant for a moment on the state of the modern terminal and provide some suggestions for how terminal emulators might be brought into the 21st century. I particularly want to focus on features that would make terminal emulators better <em>for experts</em>. Most &lsquo;features&rsquo; on terminals seem to be for making it easier for newbies to get started with the terminal, rather than to make the terminal better once they&rsquo;ve mastered it.</p>

<p>I would like to see more than 256 color support in the terminal. This one is a no brainer.</p>

<p>Terminals should have better integration with the system clipboard. Why is selecting text so difficult. I should be able to use the system clipboard, not just for inputting and selecting text, but be able to pipe and modify that text.</p>

<p>Terminals should integrate better with the system content types. Apple has done some good work here with the <code>open</code> command. Linux should take some inspiration here.</p>

<p>I realize there are some tools out there that do some of this, but these seem to be features that should really be part of the terminal itself, not some half-baked weekend side project that never gets updated.</p>
