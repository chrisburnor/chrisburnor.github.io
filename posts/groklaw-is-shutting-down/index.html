<p>I am sympathetic to PJ here.  Email has always been terribly insecure and the shutdown of the two secure email hosting sites (Lavabit and Silent Circle) due to government tampering has been a big blow for those who wish their communication to be between them and no one else.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>I also disagree with this decision quite vehemently.  For service providers who would be unable to provide their services in an environment of snooping, I understand, but this is fundamentally an issue of law and of politics for which communication, audience, and expertise are going to be of utmost importance.  Groklaw embodies all three and would have been a valuable allied in the upcoming (and protracted) fight that these revelations are going to involve.  </p>

<p>All of this has come to light through the self sacrifice of individuals: Edward Snowden, Glen Greenwald, David Miranda. However, to win this, we do not need more principled suicides.  We need a different sort of sacrifice: to know that they are listening and to speak anyway.</p>
