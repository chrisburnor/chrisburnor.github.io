<p>When I was in elementary school, there was a division among students based on the mode of transportation used to get to school.  Those who took the bus were called &lsquo;Riders&rsquo; and those who walked to school were &lsquo;Walkers&rsquo;. As I lived so that our backyard adjoined the schoolyard, I was, naturally a walker.  The first week or so, my mom would walk with me to school, but after that I was pretty much on my own for the five minute stroll.  </p>
<p>We moved a few times when I was in middle school but again when I was in high school, we lived just down the street and again, rather than drive (which actually took longer due to traffic), I walked to school.  Sometimes it was crisp and dry in the autumn.  Sometimes it was late at night after a rehearsal. Sometimes it was super early for a pre-school activity.</p>
<p>I walked to my first job after college. (College, of course was a walking bonanza).  I couldn&rsquo;t afford a car and was working at the college so it seemed to make sense to just get an apartment close by.  I&rsquo;d walk back from work, parties, concerts and dates. </p>
<p>When I look back at my life, I realize that the vast majority of my transportation has been walking (at least by time, probably not by distance). It&rsquo;s never really been a form of exercise or something I do for environmental reasons (though I&rsquo;m happy it has those benefits). It&rsquo;s more that once you get used to the idea of walking somewhere, distances don&rsquo;t seem so great.  It may take a bit longer, but it&rsquo;s also the simplest and most straightforward way to go somewhere.</p>
<p>There is a sort of meditative quality to walking.  It&rsquo;s a time where my mind goes free and makes crazy connections between disparate ideas.  It&rsquo;s a time to call up a friend I haven&rsquo;t talked to in a while.  It&rsquo;s a time to reflect on the wind and sky and it&rsquo;s denizens.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;m a walker.</p>
