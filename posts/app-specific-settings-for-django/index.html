    <p>While Django encourages a healthy degree of decoupling in how apps and modules are structured, the settings file can very easily become a monolithic mess. There are some good resources for how <a href="http://tech.yipit.com/2011/11/02/django-settings-what-to-do-about-settings-py/">to divide up settings file between environments</a>, but with a big application, even that can leave you with a mess of configuration settings.</p>

<p>What is particularly annoying in this situation is that many of these settings really just affect one app. For example, I store JavaScript and CSS files specific to each app in <code>app_dir/static/</code> and then use <a href="https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline">django-pipeline</a> to wrap and compress all the files for deployment. However, Django Pipeline requires you to define <a href="http://django-pipeline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html">Groups</a> in your settings.py file. However, since those groups are specific to each app, it seems like they should live with the app, not in the settings file. Adding a css file shouldn&rsquo;t require me to change the settings.</p>

<p>At first I attempted to fix this by putting a settings.py file in each app&rsquo;s directory, but Django doesn&rsquo;t automatically import those files and attempting to do so manually in Django&rsquo;s own settings files lead to all sorts of messy import loops. However, I found a much simpler solution. Simply put the extra settings in the <code>__init__.py</code> file in the app root. This get&rsquo;s imported automatically when the app is installed and those settings will automatically be added to the general settings environment.</p>
