      When I was in elementary school, there was a division among students based on the mode of transportation used to get to school. Those who took the bus were called &lsquo;Riders&rsquo; and those who walked to school were &lsquo;Walkers&rsquo;. As I lived so that our backyard adjoined the schoolyard, I was, naturally a walker. The first week or so, my mom would walk with me to school, but after that I was pretty much on my own for the five minute stroll.

      I just wanted to make a quick follow-up to my previous post ranting about the state of modern terminal emulators. Hacker News recently had a link to an awesome project called FinalTerm. I can&rsquo;t say that I think it&rsquo;s perfect (not thrilled exactly about terminal autocompletion &ndash; that should be the shell&rsquo;s business), but it&rsquo;s the most promising terminal improvement I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Sadly there&rsquo;s no OSX support on the horizon.

      When I started blogging, I imagined that my blog would end up like many of those that I follow and value: filled with little technical tidbits, tutorials and analyses. Starting off out of college, I recall being in awe at those who knew All The Things and would so generously share them with the world. At that time, I was reading blogs more about how to set up a Wordpress site or install Google Analytics.

      ​I played a lot of Risk as a kid (well, actually as a teenager and adult too) and observed the emergent strategies that players take in that game. Most players, after the first few terms tend to be holed up in one area of the board: Australia, South America, Europe. They don&rsquo;t have a continent per say, but they at least control a foothold in an area, which they defend vigorously, dumping all their armies on every term.

      Great Op-Ed piece in the New York Times
 &ldquo;The N.S.A. has intentionally acquired information it is not allowed to have, even under the terrifyingly broad auspices of the FISA Amendments Act.&rdquo;  Remember that the Patriot Act was highly controversial when it was originally passed even in the form that it was originally interpretted.
 Leave aside the Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act for a moment, and turn to the Constitution.
